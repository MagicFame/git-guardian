Hey, this is my solution for the exercices.
As I don't have the time because I am not able to works in the next week, I just works on the first exercices (1, 2, 3).

I saw at the end that I should push it to a git repository, therefore this is a "single commit" push with all the modification. Sorry for the inconvenience.
Jérémie.
